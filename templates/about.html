		  <h4>What we do</h4>
          <p class="mb-4 lead">
            At <strong>Work<em>ish</em></strong>, we believe that finding a job shouldn't feel like surviving an obstacle course. We listen, we guide, and we work with you to find opportunities that sure where you're headed - not just where you've been.</p>
          <p class="lead">We're not fans of buzzwords, vague job specs, or being ghosted (don't worry, we won't do it to you either). We prefer plain English, proper feedback, and knowing the difference between a “fast-paced environment” and a chaotic mess. Our job is to cut through the noise, connect great people, and ideally, make you feel a little less like throwing your laptop out the window. We're human, we're helpful, and we're just the right amount of work<em>ish</em>.</p>

				  	<h4>2019 — Sparked by Frustration</h4>
				  	<p>After years of watching people get overlooked, undervalued, or pushed into roles that didn’t fit, Workish began as a side project — a better way to help people find work that works for them.</p>

					<h4>2020 — First Clients, First Wins</h4>
					<p>We helped our first candidates land roles they were excited about — not just ones that ticked boxes. And we helped hiring managers cut through noise to meet real talent.</p>

          			<h4>2021 — Word Gets Around</h4>
          			<p>Without advertising, our client list grew. So did our reach. Remote-first companies found us, and we embraced a broader way of working — across sectors and cities.</p>

          			<p>We brought on brilliant people who believe in doing things differently. More empathy, more clarity, less waffle.</p>
